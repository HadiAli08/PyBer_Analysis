# PyBer_Challenge with Python

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
My manager V. Isualize has given me and OMar a new assignment that we will need to complete. Using Python, and reusing our knowledge of Pandas we will need to create a summary dataframe of the ride sharing data by city type to make it easier to understand. Then Using Matplotlib we will need to create a line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This will give a more clear and concise view of the data rather than having to go through every single line on excel and not understand anything.

## Analysis Results
- **Which City had the most/least amount of drivers and total fares?**
	 The rural cities had the least amount of drivers, with rides and total fares following the same trend. Urban cities ended up havign the most amount of drivers and total fares which makes sense since this is where most traveling will be done. Suburban was somewhere in the middle of the other two types. 
- **How did the average fare per ride end up?**
	 As can be seen below in the dataframe that I created, the average fare per driver ended up being the opposite of the amount of drivers. Even though the rural cities had the least amount of drivers, it ended up having the highest average fare! The same goes for Urban cities which had the most drivers, however the lowest average fare per ride. I would be this has to do with the scarcity of the drivers since in Urban areas there are more drivers the price has to be low to be more competitive. Whereas in the rural areas it isn't as common to need a ride which means prices will be more expensive when you do.

## Analysis Summary
Based on my findings above I would like to make some recommendations to the CEO to make the business more profitable. The first thing I would like to recommend is making shorter trips, such as those in urban areas, more expensive per mile since these are the most common type of ride. The second things I would like to recommend is to have drivers not only cover one area and not other meaning drivers can take turns covering rural, suburban or urban areas. This would help make the job much more enjoyable as there for sure is a preference by certain drivers. My last recommendation would be to make the fare variable. An example of this would be when Rural rides pick up and Urban has less requested rides, raise the price in the rural area and lower that in urban so it will make drivers spread out as well as bring in more profit.
